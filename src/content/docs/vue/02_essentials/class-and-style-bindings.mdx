A common need for data binding is manipulating an element's class list and inline styles. Since `class` and `style` are attributes, we can use `v-bind` to assign them string values dynamically, similar to other attributes. However, generating values using string concatenation can be annoying and error-prone. For this reason, Vue provides special enhancements when `v-bind` is used with `class` and `style`.

## Binding HTML Classes

### Binding to Objects

We can pass an object to `:class` (short for `v-bind:class`) to dynamically toggle classes:

```html
<div :class="{ active: isActive }"></div>
```

The above syntax means the presence of the `active` class will be determined by the truthiness of the data property `isActive`.

You can have multiple classes toggled by having more fields in the object:

```html
<div
  class="static"
  :class="{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }"
></div>
```

With the following state:

```js
const isActive = ref(true)
const hasError = ref(false)
```

It will render:

```html
<div class="static active"></div>
```

The bound object doesn't have to be inline:

```js
const classObject = reactive({
  active: true,
  'text-danger': false
})
```

```html
<div :class="classObject"></div>
```

This will render:

```html
<div class="active"></div>
```

You can also bind to a computed property that returns an object:

```js
const isActive = ref(true)
const error = ref(null)

const classObject = computed(() => ({
  active: isActive.value && !error.value,
  'text-danger': error.value && error.value.type === 'fatal'
}))
```

```html
<div :class="classObject"></div>
```

### Binding to Arrays

We can bind `:class` to an array to apply a list of classes:

```js
const activeClass = ref('active')
const errorClass = ref('text-danger')
```

```html
<div :class="[activeClass, errorClass]"></div>
```

This will render:

```html
<div class="active text-danger"></div>
```

If you want to conditionally apply a class in an array, you can use a ternary expression:

```html
<div :class="[isActive ? activeClass : '', errorClass]"></div>
```

This will always apply `errorClass`, but `activeClass` will only be applied when `isActive` is truthy.

However, this can be a bit verbose if you have multiple conditional classes. That's why it's also possible to use the object syntax inside array syntax:

```html
<div :class="[{ active: isActive }, errorClass]"></div>
```

### With Components

When you use the `class` attribute on a component with a single root element, those classes will be added to the component's root element and merged with any existing class already on it.

For example, if we have a component named `MyComponent` with this template:

```html
<!-- child component template -->
<p class="foo bar">Hi!</p>
```

Then add some classes when using it:

```html
<!-- when using the component -->
<MyComponent class="baz boo" />
```

The rendered HTML will be:

```html
<p class="foo bar baz boo">Hi!</p>
```

The same is true for class bindings:

```html
<MyComponent :class="{ active: isActive }" />
```

When `isActive` is truthy, the rendered HTML will be:

```html
<p class="foo bar active">Hi!</p>
```

If your component has multiple root elements, you would need to define which element will receive this class. You can do this using the `$attrs` component property:

```html
<!-- MyComponent template using $attrs -->
<p :class="$attrs.class">Hi!</p>
<span>This is a child component</span>
```

```html
<MyComponent class="baz" />
```

Will render:

```html
<p class="baz">Hi!</p>
<span>This is a child component</span>
```

## Binding Inline Styles

### Binding to Objects

`:style` supports binding to JavaScript object values - it corresponds to an HTML element's `style` property:

```js
const activeColor = ref('red')
const fontSize = ref(30)
```

```html
<div :style="{ color: activeColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }"></div>
```

Although camelCase keys are recommended, `:style` also supports kebab-cased CSS property names (corresponding to how they are used in CSS):

```html
<div :style="{ 'font-size': fontSize + 'px' }"></div>
```

It's often a good idea to bind to a style object directly so that the template is cleaner:

```js
const styleObject = reactive({
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: '30px'
})
```

```html
<div :style="styleObject"></div>
```

Again, object style binding is often used in conjunction with computed properties that return objects.

### With Regular Style Attributes

`:style` directives can also coexist with regular `style` attributes:

```html
<h1 style="color: red" :style="'font-size: 1em'">hello</h1>
```

This will render:

```html
<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 1em;">hello</h1>
```

### Binding to Arrays

We can bind `:style` to an array of multiple style objects. These objects will be merged and applied to the same element:

```html
<div :style="[baseStyles, overridingStyles]"></div>
```

### Auto-prefixing

When you use a CSS property that requires a vendor prefix in `:style`, Vue will automatically add the appropriate prefix. Vue does this by checking at runtime to see which style properties are supported in the current browser. If the browser doesn't support a particular property then various prefixed variants will be tested to try to find one that is supported.

### Multiple Values

You can provide an array of multiple (prefixed) values to a style property:

```html
<div :style="{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }"></div>
```

This will only render the last value in the array which the browser supports. In this example, it will render `display: flex` for browsers that support the unprefixed version of flexbox.
