# Vue.js Reactivity Fundamentals

Vue.js offers a powerful reactivity system that automatically updates the DOM when underlying data changes. This document covers key concepts of Vue's reactivity system.

## Declaring Reactive State

### Using `ref()`

In Composition API, the recommended way to declare reactive state is using the `ref()` function:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0)
```

`ref()` takes the argument and returns it wrapped within a ref object with a `.value` property:

```js
const count = ref(0)
console.log(count) // { value: 0 }
console.log(count.value) // 0

// Modifying the value
count.value++
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

### Using in Components

To access refs in a component's template, declare and return them from a component's `setup()` function:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

export default {
  // `setup` is a special hook dedicated for the Composition API.
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)
    
    // expose the ref to the template
    return {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

In the template:

```html
<div>{{ count }}</div>
```

**Important**: Notice that we do **not** need to append `.value` when using the ref in the template. For convenience, refs are automatically unwrapped when used inside templates.

### Using `<script setup>`

With Single-File Components (SFCs), you can use the simpler `<script setup>` syntax:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0)
function increment() {
  count.value++
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">
    {{ count }}
  </button>
</template>
```

Top-level imports, variables, and functions declared in `<script setup>` are automatically usable in the template of the same component.

## Why Refs?

You might wonder why we need refs with the `.value` property instead of plain variables. This is related to how Vue's reactivity system works:

1. When you use a ref in a template and change its value later, Vue automatically detects the change and updates the DOM.
2. This is made possible with a dependency-tracking based reactivity system.
3. When a component renders for the first time, Vue **tracks** every ref that was used during the render.
4. Later, when a ref is mutated, it will **trigger** a re-render for components that are tracking it.

In standard JavaScript, there's no way to detect access or mutation of plain variables. However, we can intercept the get and set operations of an object's properties using getter and setter methods.

Conceptually, a ref looks like this:

```js
// pseudo code, not actual implementation
const myRef = {
  _value: 0,
  get value() {
    track()
    return this._value
  },
  set value(newValue) {
    this._value = newValue
    trigger()
  }
}
```

## Using `reactive()`

Another way to declare reactive state is with the `reactive()` API:

```js
import { reactive } from 'vue'
const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
```

Usage in template:

```html
<button @click="state.count++">
  {{ state.count }}
</button>
```

### Reactive vs. Ref

1. `reactive()` makes an object itself reactive, while `ref()` wraps the inner value in a special object.
2. `reactive()` creates a proxy of the original object.
3. `reactive()` converts the object deeply - nested objects are also wrapped with `reactive()`.

### Limitations of `reactive()`

1. **Limited value types**: It only works for object types (objects, arrays, and collection types like `Map` and `Set`). It cannot hold primitive types like `string`, `number`, or `boolean`.

2. **Cannot replace entire object**: Since Vue's reactivity tracking works over property access, we must always keep the same reference to the reactive object.

   ```js
   let state = reactive({ count: 0 })
   // the above reference ({ count: 0 }) is no longer tracked
   state = reactive({ count: 1 })
   ```

3. **Not destructure-friendly**: When we destructure a reactive object's primitive type property into local variables, or pass that property into a function, we lose the reactivity connection.

   ```js
   const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
   
   // count is disconnected from state.count when destructured
   let { count } = state
   // does not affect original state
   count++
   ```

Due to these limitations, Vue recommends using `ref()` as the primary API for declaring reactive state.

## Deep Reactivity

Refs can hold any value type, including deeply nested objects, arrays, or JavaScript built-in data structures like `Map`.

A ref makes its value deeply reactive. This means changes are detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

const obj = ref({
  nested: { count: 0 },
  arr: ['foo', 'bar']
})

function mutateDeeply() {
  // these will work as expected.
  obj.value.nested.count++
  obj.value.arr.push('baz')
}
```

Non-primitive values are turned into reactive proxies via `reactive()`, which is called by `ref()` internally when the ref value is an object.

## Additional Ref Unwrapping Details

### As Reactive Object Property

A ref is automatically unwrapped when accessed or mutated as a property of a reactive object:

```js
const count = ref(0)
const state = reactive({
  count
})

console.log(state.count) // 0

state.count = 1
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

If a new ref is assigned to a property linked to an existing ref, it will replace the old ref:

```js
const otherCount = ref(2)
state.count = otherCount
console.log(state.count) // 2
// original ref is now disconnected from state.count
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

### Caveat in Arrays and Collections

Unlike reactive objects, there is **no** unwrapping performed when the ref is accessed as an element of a reactive array or a native collection type like `Map`:

```js
const books = reactive([ref('Vue 3 Guide')])
// need .value here
console.log(books[0].value)

const map = reactive(new Map([['count', ref(0)]]))
// need .value here
console.log(map.get('count').value)
```

### Caveat when Unwrapping in Templates

Ref unwrapping in templates only applies if the ref is a top-level property in the template render context:

```js
const count = ref(0)
const object = { id: ref(1) }
```

In the template:
- `{{ count + 1 }}` works as expected
- `{{ object.id + 1 }}` does NOT work, because `object.id` is not unwrapped

To fix this, we can destructure the ref into a top-level property:

```js
const { id } = object
```

Then `{{ id + 1 }}` will work correctly.

A ref does get unwrapped if it is the final evaluated value of a text interpolation (a `{{ }}` tag), so `{{ object.id }}` will render `1` and is equivalent to `{{ object.id.value }}`.

## DOM Update Timing

When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in the update cycle to ensure each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the `nextTick()` global API:

```js
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

async function increment() {
  count.value++
  await nextTick()
  // Now the DOM is updated
}
```
